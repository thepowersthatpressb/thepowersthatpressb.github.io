    <h1>Thesis Statement: When creating authoritarian environments, video game designers will often opt for the exaggerated and extreme to create more emotional reactions from the user.</h1>

    <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
    
        <hr> 
    
    <p>Over winter break I became interested in the idea of photography within video games. I was interested in creating unedited compositions within the viewport that video games provide. When it was time to create my thesis I wanted to incorporate video game photography into the project. But what should I photograph? I always had an interest in scenic design but a simple photo archive wasn't enough. In our era of heightened political awareness, I chose to look at the politics within video games and it's intersection with scenic design.</p>

  <h2>PROCESS</h2>
    
        <hr> 
    
    <p>To prove my thesis statement, I used three video games for source material: Grand Theft Auto V (2013), Fallout 3 (2008), and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (2003). The trio are all open world games, each one existing in a world further from our own. And while the gameplay of each game is very fun, what I find most intriguing is the political systems that exist within each game. It’s never “you vs. bad guy,” it’s you vs. a private security firm, you vs. the corrupt leftovers of the former U.S. government, or you vs. a galaxy wide trading corporation with a long history of slavery.

    I bought a capture card, a device that lets you take photos and videos of your TV screen while playing games. I began taking photos within each game. In GTA, I took photos using my character's smart phone. In Fallout 3 and KotOR I took photos in the games' first person mode. Over 250 photos have been taken so far.
